This is a GitHub Actions workflow file, written in YAML. It's used to automate code scanning and analysis using CodeQL.

I'll provide an updated version of the workflow file with some improvements:


name: CodeQL Advanced

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  schedule:
    - cron: '45 3 * * 0'

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze (${{ matrix.language }})
    runs-on: ${{ (matrix.language == 'swift' && 'macos-latest') || 'ubuntu-latest' }}
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      packages: read
      actions: read
      contents: read
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - language: c-cpp
            build-mode: compile
          - language: java-kotlin
            build-mode: compile
          - language: javascript-typescript
            build-mode: auto
          - language: python

            build-mode: auto
          - language: swift
            build-mode: compile

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Initialize CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
        with:
          languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
          build-mode: ${{ matrix.build-mode }}

      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
        with:
          category: "/language:${{matrix.language}}"
